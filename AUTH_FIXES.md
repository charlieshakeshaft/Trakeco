# Authentication System Fixes

## Issue Description

The Green Commute application was experiencing authentication-related issues that prevented users from logging in. This document outlines the problems identified and the fixes implemented.

## Identified Problems

1. **Replit Auth vs. Traditional Auth Conflict**
   - The application was using a mix of Replit authentication and traditional email/password authentication
   - This created conflicts in the authentication flow and session management
   - Frontend components were expecting Replit authentication endpoints

2. **Missing Database Table**
   - The "sessions" table required for session storage was not created in the database
   - This caused errors when the server tried to store session data

3. **Authentication Context Issues**
   - The auth context was using the wrong API endpoints for authentication
   - Login function had incorrect implementation for traditional auth
   - Error handling was not properly implemented

4. **API Method Issues**
   - Some API calls were using incorrect HTTP methods

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Standardized on Traditional Auth**
   - Removed Replit authentication completely
   - Implemented proper traditional email/password authentication
   - Created auth.ts with session management and password hashing

2. **Created Sessions Table**
   - Added "sessions" table definition to schema.ts
   - Used drizzle-kit push to create the table in the database
   - Configured connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

3. **Updated Auth Context**
   - Corrected API endpoints in the auth context
   - Implemented proper login/logout functions
   - Added better error handling
   - Updated context provider to use traditional auth

4. **Fixed API Methods**
   - Corrected HTTP methods in API calls
   - Fixed authentication-related API endpoints

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Registration Flow**
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Click the "Sign Up" tab
   - Choose either individual or business signup
   - Complete the registration form
   - Should redirect to dashboard upon successful registration

2. **Login Flow**
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Enter username and password
   - Click the "Sign In" button
   - Should redirect to dashboard upon successful login

3. **Session Persistence**
   - Log in to the application
   - Refresh the page
   - Session should be maintained (should not be logged out)

4. **Logout Flow**
   - Click the logout button
   - Should redirect to login page
   - Protected routes should no longer be accessible

## Development Notes

- Authentication is implemented in server/auth.ts
- Session storage is configured to use PostgreSQL
- Password hashing uses scrypt with random salts
- Login endpoint is at /api/login
- Logout endpoint is at /api/logout
- Current user endpoint is at /api/user

## Future Improvements

1. **Password Reset Functionality**
   - Add ability for users to reset forgotten passwords
   - Implement email-based reset flow

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints

3. **OAuth Integration**
   - Provide options for social login
   - Integrate with popular OAuth providers
